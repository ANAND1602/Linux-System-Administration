### Guidelines for Contributors

This document provides guidelines for suggesting changes to this Linux System Administion project. The rules are few and fairly simple.

### LaTeX

This book is generated using the LaTeX document preparation system. I would be very pleased to receive recommendations on how to improve the quality of the final product, the PDF document called main.pdf. Thus, I would happily countenance suggestions that would improve the quality of the  typesetting and general appearance.

If you wish to supply actual code examples in the LaTeX format, I ask that you use the same LaTeX format for the command prompt that I use throughout the document...as well as the pound symbol for comment lines.

<p>&#35; An example of a bash command...print the current working directory.</p>

<p>&#35;</p>

<p>&#191;\tld&#191; pwd</p>

### Linux Code

Linux code should conform to standard bash syntax.
